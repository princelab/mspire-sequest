* bugfix - only applies to windows: fixes an error on windows opening srf files and searching for the internal sequest.params file.  File.open(<srf>) -> File.open(<srf>, 'rb').

== 0.0.7 / 2009-06-26

* minor bug fix in srf to sqt output in compatibility with current ms-core ms/mass tables

== 0.0.6 / 2009-06-26

* fixed bug affecting only version 0.0.5 in srf reader affecting any file where print_duplicate_references was less than the number of protein references found for a peptide, but also > 0.
* so, the srf reader now robustly supports reading srf files regardless of print_duplicate_references setting.
