== 0.0.12 / 2010-01-01

* moved over to jeweler and tests to bacon (spec/more)

== 0.0.11 / 2010-01-01

* peptides have sf value (read from srf file)

== 0.0.10 / 2009-12-03

* turned off warning if print_duplicates == 0

== 0.0.9 / 2009-09-08

* added capability to read srf files created by reading in .out/.dta folders (combined).
  NOTE: please consider this functionality beta stage as it has not been extensively tested!
* cleaned up the read_dta_files function since we don't need measured_mhs as we do that later

== 0.0.8 / 2009-06-29

* bugfix - only applies to windows: fixes an error on windows opening srf files and searching for the internal sequest.params file.  File.open(<srf>) -> File.open(<srf>, 'rb').

== 0.0.7 / 2009-06-26

* minor bug fix in srf to sqt output in compatibility with current ms-core ms/mass tables

== 0.0.6 / 2009-06-26

* fixed bug affecting only version 0.0.5 in srf reader affecting any file where print_duplicate_references was less than the number of protein references found for a peptide, but also > 0.
* so, the srf reader now robustly supports reading srf files regardless of print_duplicate_references setting.

== 0.0.5 / 2009-06-22

* fixed handling of files with print_duplicate_references = 0
* removes .hdr postfix on the fasta path for srf -> SQT output

== 0.0.4 / 2009-06-18

* srf_to_sqt.rb and srf_to_search.rb both working now

== 0.0.3 / 2009-06-16

* only dependent on very simple ms/fasta interface, no more on digest info, etc.

== 0.0.2 / 2009-05-14

* Basic SRF to SQT translation working
* SQT reading working

== 0.0.1 / 2009-05-11

* pulled out of mspire core
